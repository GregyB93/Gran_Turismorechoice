# Gran_Turismorechoice1

In this challenge, you will be required to create a simple product configurator for new car models in any game engine, platform, and development language of your choice.
The configurator will be an application that can display a selection of car models, one at a time, and display the price and specifications of the selected model.

Requirements:

The final version must run as a standalone application, either online or offline. The user must be able to do the following:
Change the colour of the car, or add accessories, and have the price update to reflect the changes. All options can be hard-coded; there is no need for databases or saving to external files.
Select, a different car model in the list.

What are we looking for?
Graphic quality and details are not important for this task, instead, want to see how you designed and created the functionality. The code is the focus.
We are interested in seeing how you use functions/methods, lists, and loop types.
